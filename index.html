      <strong>8th – 9th September</strong>
      It’s the 8th of September and I’m supposed to be at lectures… I couldn’t make myself come in and pretend that something’s gonna get through my head when the thoughts of you are blocking the way… Instead I sit here in lecture room 4, on my spot down on the floor, the spot wherein I usually watch you sleep in peace hoping that the call wouldn’t end until I get back home so I could stare at you a little bit longer. I’m here on my spot watching the show you told me to watch, there were scenes that I should feel happy and “kilig” but those emotions don’t seem to come to me… All I know is, watching this show makes me feel like I’m still closer to you even though you’re countries away and as if you didn’t create a distance between how we were…

      By the way, the dress I’m going to wear for make sister’s wedding came right before I left for campus, I tried it on and in an instant my thoughts were “My baby would like this” oh how I loved for you to see it. It is know the 9th of September, I woke up at 1am, in fact I always do, like clockwork. “Why?” You might ask, it’s because I trained myself to wake up at these hours so I could talk to you. I also just had a long shower, not because I was doing a lot but because I was feeling a lot… I also ran earlier, hoping that I could run away from my emotions, I’m in utter pain, I miss you so much, I don’t want things to end. I hope you message me and say that everything will be okay and that you miss me as well… 

      I know I’m stronger than this, I know I should at least try to go to lectures, but just this once I want to let the pain and sadness consume me… I’ve been holding it for too long and I’m afraid that I might just burst out. I promise it’s just this once.
