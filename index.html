      <strong>September – Entry 3</strong>
      Hey baby, I just got home from lectures I only got ecos today. As expected, I took notes but didn’t understand a thing. I only got to see Brogan today, I told her what has happened. She’s the only one I feel like I can totally talk to these past few days, the moment we locked eyes after I told her I cried, my notes were full of teardrops, it’s funny looking back at it now, trying to keep it together while in lectures. I also cried to my sister last night, she didn’t ask for any details she was just there… We’re watching TSITP atm, it’s supposed to make me feel a little better, happier or lighter but it doesn’t. It’s getting harder for me to find joy in the little things that I used to get it from… As I’ve said I decided to have a break from social media, because for the first time, I wanted to grieve alone… I wanted to feel everything even if it’s just pain, hoping that someday I would feel joy, that I would like myself again… Nothing much has happened just a lot of absent staring and thinking. I’m planning to go to culinary school after I graduate, either in the Cape or back in PH. I needed to change my plans because it seems like a future with you is out of the picture now… So after culinary I’m applying at my friend’s job in a cruise ship, the friend that I said I would ask to be my witness when we get married… 

      I have tons of things to do, but I would still be thinking of you in between tasks. I love you still, I love you always.

      <strong>September – Entry 2</strong>
      Hey! So here I go again, typing the things I should be telling you through our usual calls, but guess I have to settle for this, I call this series of letters to you “Things better left unsaid”. But yeah, it’s another day but same old feeling… I’m watching your series and wow, I thought Dan would die lol, he’s acting kinda fishy tho, I mean every move looks planned… Anyway hate the new guy, such an ass!! On the other hand, I’m at campus at lecture room 4 and yes at my usual spot, I’m also doing my paper for conlaw and it’s due on next monday. Well, I guess I’ll talk to you later baby, I can call you that right? Since it’s only here anyway, on a note hidden in a folder called things better left unsaid…

      I’m home and I have online class at the moment. Well to start off this part, i don’t know if anybody will notice my absence but I deleted my instagram and bigo app, mostly because I stopped myself from checking your profiles or waiting for you to call or message, a part of me was saying “no don’t go AWOL, what if he looks for you?” I miss you but I have to because if that time does come, I know you’ll find ways to get through me, I will never leave my doors closed for you in that moment. Also because I want to stop myself from reading our conversation specially on IG, damn that will crush me even more…

      <strong>8th – 9th September</strong>
      It’s the 8th of September and I’m supposed to be at lectures… I couldn’t make myself come in and pretend that something’s gonna get through my head when the thoughts of you are blocking the way… Instead I sit here in lecture room 4, on my spot down on the floor, the spot wherein I usually watch you sleep in peace hoping that the call wouldn’t end until I get back home so I could stare at you a little bit longer. I’m here on my spot watching the show you told me to watch, there were scenes that I should feel happy and “kilig” but those emotions don’t seem to come to me… All I know is, watching this show makes me feel like I’m still closer to you even though you’re countries away and as if you didn’t create a distance between how we were…

      By the way, the dress I’m going to wear for my sister’s wedding came right before I left for campus, I tried it on and in an instant my thoughts were “My baby would like this” oh how I loved for you to see it. It is now the 9th of September, I woke up at 1am, in fact I always do, like clockwork. “Why?” You might ask, it’s because I trained myself to wake up at these hours so I could talk to you. I also just had a long shower, not because you were doing a lot but because you were feeling a lot… I also ran earlier, hoping that I could run away from my emotions, I’m in utter pain, I miss you so much, I don’t want things to end. I hope you message me and say that everything will be okay and that you miss me as well… 

      I know I’m stronger than this, I know I should at least try to go to lectures, but just this once I want to let the pain and sadness consume me… I’ve been holding it for too long and I’m afraid that I might just burst out. I promise it’s just this once.
